Skoshi's Discord Bot for them and their friends
================================================

How to set up:
--------------
To set up the bot you will need 3 things: 
1. A Python 3 interpreter which can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. To set up and get the token of a Discord bot which can be done [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
3. A minecraft sever, the bot is made for a simple [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) server so if you're using something else you will need to edit the start.sh file in the minecraftServer folder, you will also need to replace the start.sh file if you intend on running this on a non-linux system

This bot was made with the help of [James S](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHbN_gB30Tw)'s great video tutorials
